# tiQtoQ Software Developer Interview Challenge

Build a **Change Risk Analyser**: a small application that helps a development team understand the testing risk associated with a proposed software change.

## Scenario

We build platforms that help software teams integrate AI throughout the Software Development Lifecycle.

Your challenge is to add a small feature to an existing Next.js application that helps a development team understand the **testing risk associated with a software change**.

You should aim to spend approximately **1–2 hours** on the challenge.

---

## Start here: Fork this repository

All activity for this challenge **MUST** happen in a fork of this public repository on your own GitHub account.

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account using the **Fork** button on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally and make all changes and commits in that fork.
3. Do not commit directly to the original repository. The original repository should only be used as the source for your fork and the destination for your final pull request.

Use your own fork URL in the commands below:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user>/tiQtoQ-Dev-Interview-Challenge.git
Set-Location tiQtoQ-Dev-Interview-Challenge
git remote add upstream https://github.com/tiQtoQ-UK/tiQtoQ-Dev-Interview-Challenge.git
```

The `upstream` remote is optional, but can be used to retrieve updates from the original repository if needed. Push your work to `origin`, which must be your fork.

## The Feature

Build a **Change Risk Analyser**.

A user should be able to enter a description of a proposed software change, for example:

> Add the ability for administrators to reset another user's MFA configuration.

Your application should analyse the change and present useful information back to the development team.

At a minimum, display:

- **Risk Level:** Low / Medium / High
- **Areas potentially impacted**
- **Recommended testing activities**

For example:

### Risk
**High**

### Impacted Areas
- Authentication
- User permissions
- Audit logging
- Security

### Recommended Testing
- Verify only authorised administrators can reset MFA.
- Verify existing MFA users continue to authenticate successfully.
- Verify the reset action is recorded in the audit log.
- Verify users cannot reset another user's MFA through the API without permission.

# Requirements

## Required

Your solution should:

- Use **TypeScript**
- Use **Next.js**
- Accept a description of a software change
- Analyse the change
- Present the result clearly to the user
- Be structured in a way that could reasonably be extended in a production application

The analysis mechanism is deliberately left open to you.

You may use:

- deterministic application logic
- an AI model
- a combination of both

We are more interested in your engineering decisions than the visual design of the application.

# Things We Value

There isn't one correct implementation.

We will particularly look at the following areas.

## Software Design

We'd like to see code that demonstrates:

- clear separation of concerns
- sensible abstractions
- readable TypeScript
- appropriate error handling
- components/classes/functions with clear responsibilities

Avoid unnecessary complexity — this is a small feature.

---

## Get started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 22 LTS](https://nodejs.org/) or later
- Git

The repository pins its `pnpm` version. Corepack, included with supported Node.js releases, will use it automatically.

```powershell
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The Change Risk Analyser page is the UI integration point for your work.

## Workspace layout

```
ui/       Next.js TypeScript UI starter
api/      TypeScript API workspace — choose and add your own framework
shared/   Empty TypeScript workspace for contracts or reusable code you choose to share
```

`api` intentionally has no source files, HTTP framework, routes, or dependencies. `shared` intentionally has no contracts or validation. Define those boundaries as part of your solution; do not use Next.js API routes for the backend.

## The challenge

Spend approximately **1–2 hours** adding a feature that accepts a description of a proposed software change and presents a useful analysis to the development team.

For example:

> Add the ability for administrators to reset another user's MFA configuration.

At a minimum, display:

- a risk level: Low, Medium, or High;
- areas potentially impacted; and
- recommended testing activities.

Your solution must use TypeScript, Next.js, and a standalone TypeScript API. The analysis may use deterministic logic, an AI model, or both. AI is optional.

The supplied UI is static on purpose: connect its action to your API and replace the empty assessment states with your result. It is not a partial solution to the challenge.

## Useful commands

```powershell
pnpm dev        # start the Next.js UI
pnpm typecheck  # type-check the UI
pnpm lint       # lint the UI
pnpm build      # create a production UI build
```

Add API and shared-package commands as your design requires. Update the root commands if your finished solution needs to run the UI and API together.

## What we value

We assess engineering judgement more than feature quantity. Prioritise clear TypeScript, separation of concerns, appropriate error handling, and highly testable business logic. A small, well-tested solution is preferable to a large feature that is hard to understand or verify.

AI is not required. If you use it, treat it as an external, non-deterministic dependency: make the provider replaceable, validate its output before use, and handle malformed responses or failures deliberately.

# Bonus Ideas

If you have time, you could implement one or more of the following:

- Generate suggested test cases using AI
- Categorise tests as Unit / Integration / API / UI
- Identify security or accessibility concerns
- Allow the user to regenerate recommendations
- Show why the change was given its risk rating
- Return structured AI output rather than free-form text
- Add observability around AI requests
- Add an abstraction allowing different AI models to be selected
- Deploy the application to Azure
- Add Aspire support (https://aspire.dev) to allow easy local deployment

These are deliberately optional.

**Do not sacrifice code quality to implement bonus functionality.**

## Submission

Push your completed source code and commits to your fork, then open a pull request **from your fork to the original repository**. Add `@chrisusher-tt` as the reviewer.

Please document running instructions, assumptions, and a short note on what you would improve with more time. 

Be ready to discuss your architecture, testing approach, AI usage (if any), and time-based trade-offs.
